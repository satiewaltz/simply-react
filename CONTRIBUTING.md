# Contributing Guide

Feel free to clone the project to work on any issues.
Or open any issues if you've found any problem working from this boilerplate. Don't be afraid to open a PR for anything that'll make this boilerplate more awesome!

Here's a simple step-by-step process to get started:
1. Find an issue you'll want to work on.
2. If it looks interesting to you to work on - add a comment to let everyone know you've claimed it!
3. Fork the repository, make a new branch, and start working on the issue.
4. Open a pull request and don't forget to add the branch you've added your code on.
5. It'll be reviewed to make sure it's good to merge - if it is - then you're done!
